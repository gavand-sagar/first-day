Angular Performance Optimization Techniques

Lazy Loading Modules
Load modules only when needed, reducing the initial load time.

Code Splitting
Split the application into smaller bundles to load only the necessary code for the current view.

Optimize API Calls
Reduce the number of API calls, batch requests, and implement efficient pagination and filtering on the server side.

Dynamic Imports
Use dynamic imports for features that are rarely used or loaded only upon user interaction.

Tree Shaking
Remove unused code during the build process to reduce bundle size.

Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation
Compile Angular templates during the build phase, reducing the runtime overhead.

OnPush Change Detection Strategy
Use OnPush to limit change detection cycles, which can minimize unnecessary checks.

Pure Pipes
Implement pure pipes for immutability and performance, as they only execute when their inputs change.

*TrackBy with ngFor
Use trackBy with *ngFor to improve the performance of list rendering by minimizing DOM manipulations.

Virtual Scrolling
Implement virtual scrolling for large lists to render only the visible items.

Optimizing Template Bindings
Minimize the number of bindings and avoid complex expressions directly in the template.

Reduce the Number of Components
Limit the number of components and directives in critical paths to reduce the rendering overhead.


Service Worker & Caching
Use Angular Service Worker for caching static assets and API responses, improving load times and offline support.


HTTP Interceptor Caching
Implement caching with HTTP interceptors to avoid redundant network requests and speed up data retrieval.



Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Use Angular Universal for server-side rendering, improving initial load time and SEO.


Bundle Analyzer
Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to analyze and optimize the bundle size.

Deferred Initialization
Delay initialization of services and components until they are actually needed.

Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Serve static assets through a CDN to reduce latency and improve delivery speed.
